# EdiTree : Rhino Grasshopper Add-ons for Data Tree Management

EdiTree is the first set of useful open source Rhino Grasshopper components developed by EDIT Collective to provide easier manipulation of data structure and data management.

Discussions for help on using or configuring this addon can be found at:

It offers some additional features as follows, in addition to the existing data management components:

###SubTree
Retrieve a specific branch / sub-branches from a data tree. This component allows you to extract items under the specified branch, when branch path indices are assigned.
 
###Divide List
Divide a list into sub-lists by the predefined number (divisor). Any remaining item will be stored in the separate path followed by last branch.
 
###Partition List (Advanced)
Partition a list into sub-lists by partition size. This is pretty much the same as the existing Partition List component except that it gives any remaining item in a separate list.
 
###Split List (Multiple)
Split a list into separate parts at a specified index number. Similar to the existing Split List Component, each index indicates the first item in each list.
